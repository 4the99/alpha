Welcome to https://4the99.org

Due to the massive learning curve to make code absolutley secure, i have decided to go open source. 

Any help or feedback is welcome, if you wish to chipin send 4the99 or bugnuts a message we would be vastly greatfull for it. 

All code must folow the folowing principles: 

Security without compromise. If it cant be done secure, then we dont do it untill we can.
I will do everything i can to make sure everything is secure, however i am just a mere mortal, i will need help. 

Personally Identifiable Information (PID) of our users is sacrosanct.
If a user puts in any information that could be used to trace them back to their true identity, we protect it with anything and everything that we feesably can do so. (econimes of scale) 

Users have complete control of their information. 
All users can see, edit, and modify virtually everything we colect about them. The few rare eceptions to this rule is on the level of some dumb jihadi scum. 

Minamilst disclosre to 3rd parties. 
For example, It is not nessasary to disclose the date of birth, or name, or virtually any details to ship a package, other than where to send it, and payment. We fully indend to be a privacy shield against the internt to much information is colleced stored in inseure databases, websites are getting hacked right and center "big data" tracking and collection is everywhere the more we can protect and minimise to keep our uses safe the beter. 

Maimum usability and coustomoisation (if so desired) some peoople like things simple and easy, others like tweaking everything we wish to cater to both worlds, nice and simple yet can me modified to however they like (within reason) 

Last but not least, im not sure what to say on a half formed idea, but leave it up for the world to say, (at last for the "upper managment" to decide and vote on whats fair for pay. "lower managment and workers" this can bring issues in diffrencees of currency value, exange rate and cost of living. vs country x, y, or z, i bluntly want to treat em right, and not have to worry about bills, or anything. 

If in doubt, deny access. 
For ecample one person may like to keep chatlogs, the other dosent, in communucation between both of them, no chat logs will be kept. 

Personal saftey is everything. 
There will be vast, ammounts of work into keeping our users safe, and we have many creative solotions to implenment, everything from walking home late at night, to helping seach and rescue in the middle of a natural disaster, to critical life saving information when seconds count. 

Open Book financial records, (live recods) That said, user privacy is also a major contributing factor so some things will have to be generalised to state/country for tax pourposes 

So, So, So............. much more to say, but happy xmass! Watch this space it will! be intresting.
