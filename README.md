Welcome to https://4the99.org

Due to the massive learning curve to make code absolutely secure, I have decided to go open source. 

Any help or feedback is welcome, if you wish to chip in send 4the99/admin a message/email we would be vastly grateful for it. 



All code must follow the following principles: 

Security without compromise. 
If it can't be done secure, then we won't do it until we can.
We will do everything we can to make sure everything is absolutely secure, however we are just mere mortals, We will need the help. Most of the delays are because of depression/security concerns and the vast amount of research and upskilling ongoing into protecting every layer (not just the site) from every known attack we can think of theoretical or not. Ultimate secuity is after all the holy grail, a lofty goal and perhaps a delusional fantasty, but we can try, we can try. 

Personally Identifiable Information (PII) of our users is sacrosanct.
If a user puts in any information that could be used to trace them back to their true identity, we protect it with anything and everything that we feasible can do so. (economies of scale) 

Users have complete control of their information. 
All users can see, edit, and modify virtually everything we collect about them. The few rare exceptions to this rule is on the level of some dumb jihadi scum. Situations like this are simple, if they are a threat to them selves, others, general public, or our infrastructure we may reluctantly forced to breach their privacy and to take action. The net is the net, the world is the world. Problems will arise weather we want them to or not. 

Minimalist disclosure to 3rd parties. 
For example, It is not strictly necessary to disclose the date of birth, or name, or virtually any details to ship a package, other than where to send it, and valid payment has been received. We fully indeed to be a privacy shield against the internet to much information is collected stored in insecure databases, websites are getting hacked right and center "big data" tracking and collection is everywhere and for sale. The more we can protect and minimize to keep our users safe the better. 

Maximum usability and customization (if so desired)
Some people like things simple and easy, others like tweaking everything we wish to cater to both worlds, nice and simple yet can be modified to however they like (within reason) 

If in doubt, deny access. 
For example one person may like to keep chat logs, the other doesn't, in communication between both of them, no chat logs will be kept. 

Personal safety is everything. 
There will be vast, amounts of work into keeping our users safe, and we have many creative solutions to implement, everything from walking home late at night, to helping search and rescue in the middle of a natural disaster, to critical life saving information when seconds count. Such things especially around gps techonogy are opt in/only activated when lives are in imment danger.

Open Book financial records, (live records) 
That said, user privacy is also a major contributing factor so some things will have to be generalized to state/country for tax purposes (ecept for the user themselves) where they can track the money they have spent/saved/donated/earned etc.

So, So, So............. Much more to say, but happy xmass! Watch this space it will! be interesting.
