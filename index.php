just dumping to keep <br />
Across the world, billions of people are starving to death. <br />
Global warming has now been declared a scientific certainty.<br />
Companies for legal and tax reasons need to reduce their carbon footprint. <br />
So lets plant some trees, but who ever said those trees cant grow food?<br />
Over time this can only grow in size for the main cost being land acquisition, infrastructure, equipment and planting<br />
Vast quantity of food will be available for those that need it the most.<br />
This after all, is nothing more than a box to tick upon company registration,<br />
a percentage of sales to allocate, and a donation to balance out at the end of the financial year.<br />
A simple idea, massive impact, and one of the countless plans we have on the table.<br />
